# Checkers

The player with the red checkers moves first. Checkers may only move one diagonal space forward (toward your opponent's checkers) in the beginning of the game.

If your checker is located in the diagonal space nearest to your opponent's checker, then you can jump and capture that checker.

*  If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker, then you have to take it.

* If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker in multiple parts of the board, then you can choose which checkers you'd like to jump.


King your checkers when they reach the end of your opponent's board.

When a player captures all thier opponets checkers, they win.
